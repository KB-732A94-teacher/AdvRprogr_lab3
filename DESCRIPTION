Description: Euclidean algorithm is an efficient way of finding the greatest common divisor for two numbers. The function in this package is based on the pseudocode provided in the wikipedia page of Euclidean Algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for for finding the shortest paths between vertices in a given graph. The function in this package is also based on the pseudocode provided in Wikipedia page of Dijkstra's algorithm.
